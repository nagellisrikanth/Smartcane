# Smartcane
In this project I tried to built a small sensor module that can be attached to the traditional white cane so that it can detect obstacles above the knee height. The sensor module consists of ultrasonic sensor attached to a servo motor and the entire module scan for obstacles in vertical direction when the user sweaps the canes  from left to right. The sensor module needs to be interface and it is done by using the above source code.

Programming Platform: Arduino  
The source code for interfacing the sensor is present in the SR04Test.ino file
