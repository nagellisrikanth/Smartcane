# Smartcane
In this project I tried to built a small sensor module that can be attached to the traditional white cane so that it can detect obstacles above the knee height. The sensor module consists of ultrasonic sensor attached to a servo motor and the entire module scan for obstacles in vertical direction when the user sweaps the canes  from left to right
